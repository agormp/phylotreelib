## Availability

The phylotreelib.py module is available on GitHub: https://github.com/agormp/phylotreelib and on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/phylotreelib/

## Installation

```
python3 -m pip install phylotreelib
```

## Highlights

* Methods for reading and writing Nexus and Newick format tree files
* Trees can be interrogated to find e.g. the parents or children of specific nodes, to find the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a set of leaves, to find the N leaves that are closest to a specified leaf, to find the longest path on the tree, etc.
* Possible to iterate over all subtrees in Tree object
* Trees can be rooted using either midpoint, outgroup, or minimum-variance rooting
* Trees can be pruned to a smaller, specified number of representative leaves
* Nodes can be inserted or deleted while keeping the rest of the tree structure sane, leaves can be renamed, branch lengths can be set
* Trees can be grafted to each other, or a subtree can be moved using subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR)
* Method for computing the distance between two trees (Robinson-Foulds, and derived normalised measures; returns information about number of unique and shared bipartitions)
* The Distmatrix class contains methods for building trees from distance matrices
* Methods for computing consensus trees from sets of input trees, which also yield information on the frequencies of clades and topologies, and on the distribution of branch lengths for bipartitions
* Library has been optimized for high speed and low memory consumption

## Quick start usage examples

### Read tree from file, perform minimum-variance rooting, find root-to-tip distances
The code below will import phylotreelib, open a NEXUS file, read one Tree object from the file, perform minimum-variance rooting, find the node ID for the new rootnode,
and finally print out the name and root-to-tip distance (measured along the branches) for all leaves in the tree:

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
treefile = pt.Nexustreefile("mytreefile.nexus")
mytree = treefile.readtree()
mytree.rootminvar()
rootnode = mytree.root
for tip in mytree.leaves:
	dist = mytree.nodedist(rootnode, tip)
	print("{:<10s}\t{:.2f}".format(tip,dist))
```

Output:

```
nitrificans	1879.84
Is79A3    	1878.95
GWW4      	1877.47
.
.
.
A2        	1879.84
communis  	1878.95
```

-----

### Construct tree from Newick string, print tabular representation
The code below constructs a Tree object from a Newick formatted string and then prints the string representation of the tree (using the Tree object's \_\_str\_\_() method).

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
mytree = pt.Tree.from_string("(Gorilla:3, (Human:2, (Chimpanzee:1, Bonobo:1):1):1);")
print(mytree)
```

Output:

```
|----------------------------------------------|
|  Node  |    Child     |  Distance  |  Label  |
|----------------------------------------------|
|     0  |           1  |         1  |         |
|     0  |     Gorilla  |         3  |         |
|     1  |           2  |         1  |         |
|     1  |       Human  |         2  |         |
|     2  |      Bonobo  |         1  |         |
|     2  |  Chimpanzee  |         1  |         |
|----------------------------------------------|

4 Leafs:
----------
Bonobo
Chimpanzee

### Read multiple trees from Nexus file, construct consensus tree, write in Newick format
The code below opens a Nexus-formatted file with multiple trees, constructs a Treesummary object, and then extracts all Tree objects from the file by iterating over the file while adding the trees to the Treesummary object. Then a majority rule consensus tree is computed from the Treesummary object, the tree is midpoint rooted, and the resulting tree is finally written in Newick format to the output file "contree.newick"

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
beastfile = pt.Nexustreefile("BEAST_samples.trees")
treesummary = pt.TreeSummary()
for tree in beastfile:
    treesummary.add_tree(tree)
consensus_tree = treesummary.contree()
consensus_tree.rootmid()
with open("contree.newick", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(consensus_tree.newick())
```

-----

### Read tree from file, find close neighbours of specified leaf
The code below opens a Newick file, reads one Tree object from the file, and then finds the 5 leaves that are closest (measured along the branches) to the leaf labeled "nitrificans".

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
treefile = pt.Newicktreefile("Comammox.newick")
tree = treefile.readtree()
print(tree.nearest_n_leaves("nitrificans", 5))
```

Output:

```python
{'A2', 'AAUMBR1', 'CG24B', 'inopinata', 'nitrosa'}
```

-----

### Read DNA alignment, construct Neighbor Joining tree
The code below opens a fasta file containing a set of aligned DNA sequences and reads the aligned sequences (using classes and methods from the [sequencelib](https://github.com/agormp/sequencelib) library), constructs a nested dictionary containing all pairwise sequence distances, constructs a Distmatrix object from this dictionary, and computes a neighbor joining tree from the distance matrix.

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
import sequencelib as seqlib
seqfile = seqlib.Seqfile("myalignment.fasta")
seqs = seqfile.read_alignment()
distdict = seqs.distdict()
dmat = pt.Distmatrix.from_distdict(distdict)
mytree = dmat.nj()
```

## Using phylotreelib

Typically, phylotreelib will be used for analysing (or manipulating) one or more trees that have been read from a textfile in Newick or Nexus format. Reading a tree from file will return a Tree object, which has methods for interrogating or altering itself (e.g. `mytree.rootmid()` will midpoint root the Tree object `mytree`).

### Opening a treefile

To open a Newick format file:

```
treefile = phylotreelib.Newicktreefile(filename)
```

To open a Nexus format file:

```
treefile = phylotreelib.Nexustreefile(filename)
```

These commands will return a file object with methods for reading the contents of the file.

### Reading one or more trees from a treefile

To read one tree from an opened treefile:

```
tree = treefile.readtree()
```

This returns a Tree object, which has methods for analysing and manipulating the tree (itself). By calling readtree() repeatedly, you can read additional trees from the file. The `readtree()` method returns `None` when all trees have been read.

The `readtrees()` method returns all the trees in the file in the form of a Treeset object. Treeset objects contains a list of Tree objects and has methods for rooting and outputting all trees in the collection. Iterating over a Treeset object returns Tree objects.

```
treeset = treefile.readtrees()
```

It is also possible to retrieve all the trees from an open treefile one at a time by iterating directly over the file (useful for minimizing memory consumptiom when handling files with many trees):

```
for tree in treefile:
	<do something with tree>
```

### Constructing Tree objects directly

Instead of reading a tree from a file, you can also construct Tree objects using one of the 3 alternative constructors in the Tree class.

#### Constructing Tree object from string

Tree objects can be constructed directly from a string (where the string is a Newick formatted tree):

```
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.from_string(mystring)
```

#### Constructing Tree object with star-tree topology from list of leaf names

Tree objects (with a star topology) can be constructed from a list of leaf names:

```
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.from_leaves(leaflist)
```

#### Constructing Tree object with random topology and branch lengths

It is possible to construct Tree objects with random tree topology using the randtree constructor:

```
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.randtree(leaflist=None, ntips=None, randomlen=False, name_prefix="s"):
```

Either a list of names (`leaflist`) or the number of tips (`ntips`) can be specified as a way of setting the size of the tree. If the function argument `randomlen` is True then branches will get random lengths drawn from a lognormal distribution.

### Structure of Tree objects

Tree objects consist of external nodes (leaves), which are identified by strings
(e.g. "Chimpanzee"), and internal nodes, which are identified by integers
(e.g., 5). Branches between nodes may have a label (string) and/or a branch
length (float) associated with them.

A textual representation of a Tree object can be obtained using: "print(mytree)" (where mytree is the name of the Tree object). The resulting output is a child-list representation of the tree followed by an alphabetical list of leafs, along these lines:

```
>>> print(mytree)

### Attributes on Tree objects

Tree objects have a number of attributes that contain information regarding the tree.

One example of using a tree attribute is (assuming we have a Tree object named "tree"):

```
taxa = tree.leaves
```

List of useful Tree object attributes:

*	`.leaves` 	: Set of leaf names
*	`.intnodes` : Set of internal node IDs
*	`.nodes`	: Set of all nodes (= leafs + internal nodes)
*	`.root`		: ID for root node (usually 0, but may change if re-rooted)


### Methods for analyzing and altering Tree objects.

Tree objects also have a number of methods that can be used to analyze and alter them.

One example of using a Tree object method is:

```
childnodes = tree.children(7)
```

which returns a set containing the node-IDs for the immediate descendants of node 7 (the nodes directly connected to node 7).

A full list of classes and methods in phylotreelib is at the end of this README

### Exceptions.

phylotreelib has its own error class ("TreeError"), which can be used for raising and catching
tree-related errors in your own program and dealing with errors intelligently:

Example usage:

```
try:
    tree.rootout(outgroup)
except phylotreelib.TreeError as err:
	print("This error occurred: {}".format(err) )
```

Example usage 2:

```
if nodename not in tree.nodes:
	raise TreeError("Tree contains no leafs named {}".format(nodename))
```

### Most important classes in phylotreelib

* **Tree**: Class representing basic phylogenetic Tree object. Methods for analyzing and manipulating tree (rooting, finding MRCA, finding children of nodes, ...)
* **TreeSet**: Class for storing and manipulating a number of trees.
* **TreeSummary**: Class summarizing bipartitions and branch lengths (but not topologies) from many trees. Method to compute consensus tree. Can return information about clade frequencies and average branch lengths (where a branch is defined as being between the two sets of leaves in a bipartition, regardless of the topologies of the subtrees).
* **BigTreeSummary**: Class summarizing bipartitions, branch lengths, and topologies from many trees (where topology is defined as the set of bipartitions corresponding to the unrooted tree). Does everything TreeSummary does and also keeps track of topologies.
* **Nexustreefile**: Class representing Nexus tree file. Iteration returns Tree objects.
* **Newicktreefile**: Class representing Newick tree file. Iteration returns Tree objects.
* **Distmatrix**: Class representing distance matrix for set of taxa. Can be constructed from distance data or directly from alignment of sequences (requires seqlib.py). Methods for computing neighbor-joining and upgma trees."""
