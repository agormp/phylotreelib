## Highlights

* Methods for reading and writing Nexus and Newick format tree files
* Trees can be interrogated to find e.g. the parents or children of specific nodes, to find the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a set of leaves, to find the N leaves that are closest to a specified leaf, to find the longest path on the tree, etc.
* Possible to iterate over all subtrees in Tree object
* Trees can be rooted using either midpoint, outgroup, or minimum-variance rooting
* Trees can be pruned to a smaller, specified number of representative leaves
* Nodes can be inserted or deleted while keeping the rest of the tree structure sane, leaves can be renamed, branch lengths can be set
* Trees can be grafted to each other, or a subtree can be moved using subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR)
* Method for computing the distance between two trees (Robinson-Foulds, and derived normalised measures; returns information about number of unique and shared bipartitions)
* The Distmatrix class contains methods for building trees from distance matrices
* Methods for computing summary tree from sets of input trees:
    * Majority rule consensus tree
	* Majority rule consensus tree, with all compatible bipartitions added
	* Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree
	* Maximum Bipartition Credibility (MBC) tree
	* Branch lengths can be set based on node depth (common ancestor or mean) and mean bipartition branch lengths.
    * Methods also yield information on the frequencies of clades and topologies, and on the distribution of branch lengths for bipartitions
* Library has been optimized for high speed and low memory consumption
* NOTE: labels are interpreted as belonging to branches (bipartitions), not to internal nodes, and this association is maintained after re-rooting etc.

## Quick start usage examples

### Read tree from file, perform minimum-variance rooting, find root-to-tip distances

The code below will import phylotreelib, open a NEXUS tree file, read one Tree object from the file, perform minimum-variance rooting, find the node ID for the new rootnode, and finally print out the name and root-to-tip distance (measured along the branches) for all leaves in the tree. (Note that pt.Nexustreefile has been implemented as a context manager, and can be used with the `with` statement):

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
with pt.Nexustreefile("mytreefile.nexus") as treefile:
    mytree = treefile.readtree()
mytree.rootminvar()
rootnode = mytree.root
for tip in mytree.leaves:
    dist = mytree.nodedist(rootnode, tip)
    print(f"{tip:<10s} \t {dist:.2f}")
```

Output:

```
nitrificans 1879.84
Is79A3      1878.95
GWW4        1877.47
.
.
.
A2          1879.84
communis    1878.95
```

### Construct tree from Newick string, print tabular representation
The code below constructs a Tree object from a Newick formatted string and then prints the string representation of the tree (using the Tree object's \_\_str\_\_() method).

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
mytree = pt.Tree.from_string("(Gorilla:3, (Human:2, (Chimpanzee:1, Bonobo:1):1):1);")
print(mytree)
```

Output:

```
|----------------------------------------------|
|  Node  |    Child     |  Distance  |  Label  |
|----------------------------------------------|
|     0  |           1  |         1  |         |
|     0  |     Gorilla  |         3  |         |
|     1  |           2  |         1  |         |
|     1  |       Human  |         2  |         |
|     2  |      Bonobo  |         1  |         |
|     2  |  Chimpanzee  |         1  |         |

### Read multiple trees from Nexus file, construct consensus tree, write in Newick format
The code below constructs a Treesummary object, opens a Nexus-formatted file with multiple trees, and then extracts all Tree objects from the file by iterating over the file while adding the trees to the Treesummary object. After this a majority rule consensus tree is computed from the Treesummary object, the tree is midpoint rooted, and the resulting tree is finally written in Newick format to the output file "contree.newick"

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
treesummary = pt.TreeSummary()
with pt.Nexustreefile("BEAST_samples.trees") as beastfile:
    for tree in beastfile:
        treesummary.add_tree(tree)
consensus_tree = treesummary.contree()
consensus_tree.rootmid()
with open("contree.newick", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(consensus_tree.newick())
```

-----

### Prune tree to representative subset of n leaves
The code below opens a Nexus format file, reads one Tree object from the file, prunes the tree such that 50 leaves remain, and writes the resulting tree, in nexus format, to a new file. The leaves are chosen such that they are maximally representative in the sense that they spread out the maximum possible percentage of the original tree length (i.e., there is no other subset of 50 leaves that would result in a tree with a larger sum of branch lenths). This can be used e.g. for reducing the size of a tree prior to computationally costly downstream analyses, or to simplify visualization (especially useful if there are many closely related leaves).

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
with pt.Nexustreefile("SARSCoV2_all.tree") as treefile:
    bigtree = treefile.readtree()
smalltree = bigtree.prune_maxlen(nkeep=50)
with open("SARSCoV2_50.tree", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(smalltree.nexus())
```

-----

### Prune tree to representative subset of n leaves, given list of leaves that must be kept
The code below opens a Nexus format file, reads one Tree object from the file, prunes the tree such that 50 leaves remain while making sure to keep the 5 leaves listed in `keeplist`, and writes the resulting tree, in nexus format, to a new file. First, the 5 leaves in keeplist are selected. Then the remaining 45 (50 - 5) leaves are chosen such that they are maximally representative in the sense that they spread out the maximum possible percentage of the original tree length (i.e., there is no other subset of 45 leaves that, together with the required leaves in keeplist, would result in a tree with a larger sum of branch lenths). This can be used e.g. for reducing the size of a tree prior to computationally costly downstream analyses, or to simplify visualization (especially useful if there are many closely related leaves).

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
with pt.Nexustreefile("SARSCoV2_all.tree") as treefile:
    bigtree = treefile.readtree()
smalltree = bigtree.prune_maxlen(nkeep=50, 
                                 keeplist=["mink1", "mink2", "mink3", "human1", "human2"])
with open("SARSCoV2_50.tree", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(smalltree.nexus())
```

-----

### Read tree from file, find close neighbours of specified leaf
The code below opens a Newick file, reads one Tree object from the file, and then finds the 5 leaves that are closest (measured along the branches) to the leaf labeled "nitrificans".

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
with pt.Newicktreefile("Comammox.newick") as treefile:
    tree = treefile.readtree()
print(tree.nearest_n_leaves("nitrificans", 5))
```

Output:

```python
{'A2', 'AAUMBR1', 'CG24B', 'inopinata', 'nitrosa'}
```

-----

### Read DNA alignment, construct Neighbor Joining tree
The code below opens a fasta file containing a set of aligned DNA sequences and reads the aligned sequences (using classes and methods from the [sequencelib](https://github.com/agormp/sequencelib) library), constructs a nested dictionary containing all pairwise sequence distances, constructs a Distmatrix object from this dictionary, and computes a neighbor joining tree from the distance matrix.

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
import sequencelib as seqlib
seqfile = seqlib.Seqfile("myalignment.fasta")
seqs = seqfile.read_alignment()
distdict = seqs.distdict()
dmat = pt.Distmatrix.from_distdict(distdict)
mytree = dmat.nj()
```

-----

### Construct random tree, perform random SPR moves on tree-copy, compute tree distances
The code below constructs a random, bifurcating tree with 50 tips and random branch lengths, creates a copy of that tree, performs 5 random Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) moves, and finally computes three different measures of tree-distance between the original tree and the SPR-transformed tree: 

* Robinson-Foulds symmetric distance
* Normalised similarity (based on RF distance; 1 = identical)
* Path difference distance (as described in [Steel and Penny, 1993](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2992536))

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
tree1 = pt.Tree.randtree(ntips=50, randomlen=True)
tree2 = tree1.copy_treeobject()
for i in range(5):
    tree2.spr()
rf = tree1.treedist_RF(tree2)
rfnorm = tree1.treedist_RF(tree2, normalise=True)
rfsimnorm = 1 - rfnorm
pd = tree1.treedist_pathdiff(tree2)
print(f"Robinson-Foulds distance: {rf}")
print(f"Normalised similarity (based on RF distance): {rfsimnorm:.2f}")
print(f"Path difference distance: {pd:.2f}")
```

-----

### Read set of input tree samples from BEAST (discarding burnin), compute maximum clade credibility tree, set branch lengths based on common ancestor heights
The code below creates a TreeSummary object that will keep track of clades and topologies in the input tree-set, opens a file containing tree samples from a BEAST run, discards the first 500 as burnin, adds the remaining trees to the TreeSummary object, computes a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from the tree-summary, sets the branch lengths based on the common ancestor heights (based on original tree file), and writes the result to a nexus file (branch labels will correspond to clade credibility values).

**NOTE**: The command-line program [sumt](https://github.com/agormp/sumt) exposes all phylotreelib's functionality related to consensus trees, and allows the user to create consensus, MCC, and MBC trees with various options for branch lengths and rooting, without having to write scripts.

```python
import phylotreelib as pt
treesummary = pt.BigTreeSummary(trackbips=False, trackclades=True, trackroot=True)
treefile = pt.Nexustreefile("SARS-CoV-2.trees")
burnin = 500
for i in range(burnin):
    treefile.readtree(returntree=False)
for tree in treefile:
    treesummary.add_tree(tree)
mcctree = treesummary.max_clade_cred_tree()
weight = 1.0
treecount = 2001
mcctree = set_ca_node_depths(mcctree, [weight, treecount, burnin, "SARS-CoV-2.trees"])
with open("SARS-CoV-2.mcc", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(mcctree.nexus())
```

## Using phylotreelib

Typically, phylotreelib will be used for analysing (or manipulating) one or more trees that have been read from a textfile in Newick or Nexus format. Reading a tree from file will return a Tree object, which has methods for interrogating or altering itself (e.g. `mytree.rootmid()` will midpoint root the Tree object `mytree`).

### Opening a treefile

To open a Newick format file:

```
treefile = phylotreelib.Newicktreefile(filename)
```

To open a Nexus format file:

```
treefile = phylotreelib.Nexustreefile(filename)
```

These commands will return a file object with methods for reading the contents of the file.

#### Treefile classes are context managers

The classes phylotreelib.Newicktreefile and phylotreelib.Nexustreefile have been implemented as context managers, so it is possible to use them with the `with` statement:

```
with phylotreelib.Nexustreefile(filename) as treefile:
    <read trees and do other stuff with treefile>
```

### Reading one or more trees from a treefile

To read one tree from an opened treefile:

```
tree = treefile.readtree()
```

This returns a Tree object, which has methods for analysing and manipulating the tree (itself). By calling readtree() repeatedly, you can read additional trees from the file. The `readtree()` method returns `None` when all trees have been read.

The `readtrees()` (plural) method returns all the trees in the file in the form of a Treeset object. Treeset objects contains a list of Tree objects and has methods for rooting and outputting all trees in the collection. Iterating over a Treeset object returns Tree objects.

```
treeset = treefile.readtrees()
```

It is also possible to retrieve all the trees from an open treefile one at a time by iterating directly over the file (useful for minimizing memory consumptiom when handling files with many trees):

```
for tree in treefile:
    <do something with tree>
```

#### Reading trees using the with statement

As mentioned, phylotreelib.Newicktreefile and phylotreelib.Nexustreefile have been implemented as context managers, and it is therefore possible (and probably safer) to read trees using the `with` statement:

```
with phylotreelib.Nexustreefile(filename) as treefile:
    tree = treefile.readtree()
```

### Constructing Tree objects directly

Instead of reading a tree from a file, you can also construct Tree objects using one of the several alternative constructors in the Tree class.

#### Constructing Tree object from string

Tree objects can be constructed directly from a string (where the string is a Newick formatted tree):

```
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.from_string(mystring)
```

#### Constructing Tree object with star-tree topology from list of leaf names

Tree objects (with a star topology) can be constructed from a list of leaf names:

```
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.from_leaves(leaflist)
```

#### Constructing Tree object from lists of parent and child nodes corresponding to branches in tree

The constructor Tree.from_branchinfo() constructs a tree from information about all individual branches in the tree. Specifically the input is a list of parent node IDs and a list of child node IDs (of the same length), such that each pairing of parentnode and  childnode corresponds to a branch in the tree. It is possible to add extra lists containing the corresponding branch lengths and branch labels. Using this constructor allows the specific naming of internal nodes (which are otherwise set automatically based on e.g. the order in which a newick string is parsed). **NOTE:** internal node IDs have to be integers, while leaf IDs have to be strings.

```
parentlist = [100, 100, 101, 101, 102, 102]
childlist = [101, 102, "A", "B", "C", "D"]
blenlist = [1,1,2,3,2,3]
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.from_branchinfo(parentlist,childlist,blenlist)
```

would result in this tree:

```
print(tree)
|-----------------------------------------|
|  Node  |  Child  |  Distance  |  Label  |
|-----------------------------------------|
|   100  |    101  |         1  |         |
|   100  |    102  |         1  |         |
|   101  |      A  |         2  |         |
|   101  |      B  |         3  |         |
|   102  |      C  |         2  |         |
|   102  |      D  |         3  |         |
|-----------------------------------------|

4 Leafs:

```

#### Constructing Tree object with random topology and branch lengths

It is possible to construct Tree objects with random tree topology using the randtree constructor:

```
tree = phylotreelib.Tree.randtree(ntips=35, randomlen=True, name_prefix="s"):
```

Either a list of names (`leaflist`) or the number of tips (`ntips`) can be specified as a way of setting the size of the tree. If the function argument `randomlen` is True then branches will get random lengths drawn from a lognormal distribution.

### Structure of Tree objects

Tree objects consist of external nodes (leaves), which are identified by strings
(e.g. "Chimpanzee"), and internal nodes, which are identified by integers
(e.g., 5). Branches between nodes may have a label (string) and/or a branch
length (float) associated with them.

A textual representation of a Tree object can be obtained using: "print(mytree)" (where mytree is the name of the Tree object). The resulting output is a child-list representation of the tree followed by an alphabetical list of leafs, along these lines:

```
>>> print(mytree)

### Attributes on Tree objects

Tree objects have a number of attributes that contain information regarding the tree.

One example of using a tree attribute is (assuming we have a Tree object named "tree"):

```
taxa = tree.leaves
```

List of useful Tree object attributes:

*   `.leaves`   : Set of leaf names
*   `.intnodes` : Set of internal node IDs
*   `.nodes`    : Set of all nodes (= leaves + internal nodes)
*   `.root`     : ID for root node (usually 0, but may change if re-rooted)


### Methods for analyzing and altering Tree objects.

Tree objects also have a number of methods that can be used to analyze and alter them.

One example of using a Tree object method is:

```
childnodes = tree.children(7)
```

which returns a set containing the node-IDs for the immediate descendants of node 7 (the nodes directly connected to node 7).

A full list of classes and methods in phylotreelib is at the end of this README

### Exceptions.

phylotreelib has its own error class ("TreeError"), which can be used for raising and catching
tree-related errors in your own program and dealing with errors intelligently:

Example usage:

```
try:
    tree.rootout(outgroup)
except phylotreelib.TreeError as err:
    print("This error occurred: {}".format(err) )
```

Example usage 2:

```
if nodename not in tree.nodes:
    raise TreeError("Tree contains no leafs named {}".format(nodename))
```

### Most important classes in phylotreelib

* **Tree**: Class representing basic phylogenetic Tree object. Methods for analyzing and manipulating tree (rooting, finding MRCA, finding children of nodes, ...)
* **TreeSet**: Class for storing and manipulating a number of trees.
* **TreeSummary**: Class summarizing bipartitions and branch lengths (but not topologies) from many trees. Method to compute consensus tree. Can return information about clade frequencies and average branch lengths (where a branch is defined as being between the two sets of leaves in a bipartition, regardless of the topologies of the subtrees).
* **BigTreeSummary**: Class summarizing bipartitions, branch lengths, and topologies from many trees (where topology is defined as the set of bipartitions corresponding to the unrooted tree). Does everything TreeSummary does and also keeps track of topologies.
* **Nexustreefile**: Class representing Nexus tree file. Iteration returns Tree objects.
* **Newicktreefile**: Class representing Newick tree file. Iteration returns Tree objects.
* **Distmatrix**: Class representing distance matrix for set of taxa. Can be constructed from distance data or directly from alignment of sequences (requires seqlib.py). Methods for computing neighbor-joining and upgma trees."""

     |  Methods inherited from TreeSummary:
     |
     |  __len__(self)
     |
     |  compute_rootcred(self, tree)
     |      Returns root credibility (frequency of tree's root among observed trees) based
     |      on current root of sum_tree and information in self._rootbip_summary
     |
     |  contree(self, cutoff=0.5, allcompat=False)
     |      Returns a consensus tree built from selected bipartitions.
     |
     |  log_bipart_credibility(self, biptopology)
     |      Compute log bipartition credibility for topology (sum of log(freq) for all branches)
     |
     |  log_clade_credibility(self, cladetopology)
     |      Compute log clade credibility for topology (sum of log(freq) for all clades)
     |
     |  root_maxfreq(self, sum_tree)
     |      Uses info about root bipartitions in TreeSummary to place root on summary tree.
     |      Also sets tree attribute rootcred:
     |          probability (freq among input trees) of current location of root
     |
     |      If tree has branch lengths:
     |      Divides length of root bipartition among two branches in accordance with average
     |      fraction of lengths seen for this rootbip across all trees.
     |
     |  set_ca_node_depths(self, sum_tree, wt_count_burnin_filename_list)
     |      Set branch lengths on summary tree based on mean node depth for clades corresponding
     |      to MRCA of clade's leaves. (same as "--height ca" in BEAST's treeannotator)
     |      This means that all input trees are used when computing
     |      mean for each node (not just the input trees where that exact monophyletic clade
     |      is present)
     |
     |  set_clade_credibility(self, tree, precision=6)
     |      Set clade credibility on provided target tree based on freq of clade in TreeSummary.
     |
     |      NOTE: only works if all clades in tree have been observed at least once. The option
     |              will therefore not work with all rootings
     |
     |  set_mean_biplen(self, sum_tree)
     |      Sets branch-length, -var, and -sem for each branch in sum_tree,
     |      based on values in bipsummary.
     |      Should only be called when sum_tree constructed based on clades (MCC),
     |      but brlens are to be set based on mean bipartition values
     |
     |  set_mean_node_depths(self, sum_tree)
     |      Set branch lengths on summary tree based on mean node depth for clades corresponding
     |      to parent and child nodes (blen = depth_parent - depth_child).
     |
     |      NOTE 1: only meaningful if input trees are based on a clock model.
     |      NOTE 2: only works if all clades in tree have been observed at least once. The option
     |              will therefore not work with all rootings, and may also fail for majority rule
     |              consensus trees
     |      NOTE 3: only uses node depths from monophyletic clades (so some values may be set
     |      based on very few trees)
     |
     |  set_rootcredibility(self, sum_tree, precision=6)
     |      Returns sum_tree with root credibilities as attributes on each branch
     |      rootcred = fraction of trees in input set where the root was on this branch (bipartition)
     |      If root was never on a branch: assign the value 0.0
     |      Added as attribute .rootcred to Branchstruct for branches on sum_tree
     |      Also sets tree-attribute cumrootcred:
     |          sum of rootcredibilities for all branches (bipartitions) included on tree

     |      Also sets tree attribute rootcred:
     |          probability (freq among input trees) of current location of root
     |
     |      If tree has branch lengths:

     |      Set branch lengths on summary tree based on mean node depth for clades corresponding
     |      to parent and child nodes (blen = depth_parent - depth_child).
     |
     |      NOTE 1: only meaningful if input trees are based on a clock model.
     |      NOTE 2: only works if all clades in tree have been observed at least once. The option
     |              will therefore not work with all rootings, and may also fail for majority rule
     |              consensus trees
     |      NOTE 3: only uses node depths from monophyletic clades (so some values may be set
     |      based on very few trees)
     |
     |  set_rootcredibility(self, sum_tree, precision=6)
     |      Returns sum_tree with root credibilities as attributes on each branch
     |      rootcred = fraction of trees in input set where the root was on this branch (bipartition)
     |      If root was never on a branch: assign the value 0.0
     |      Added as attribute .rootcred to Branchstruct for branches on sum_tree
     |      Also sets tree-attribute cumrootcred:
     |          sum of rootcredibilities for all branches (bipartitions) included on tree
     |
     |  update(self, other)
     |      Merge this object with external treesummary
